# Overview
## Bike Sharing Analysis In Tableau
In this analysis I am exploring data visualizations centered around Citibike which is a bike sharing business in New York City. My end goal is to construct a presentation deck in Tableau that I can use to see if a similar company would be successful in Des Moines, Iowa.

## Results
For my research I used data from the month of August 2019.  I picked August because the weather in August is more condusive to travel via bike given the milder weather then other months of the year where it might be more comfortable to travel by car. The sample I was using had 2,344,224 recorded rides in August, of these 81% were rides that would catagorized as "Subscription Based".
### Rides by Hour
From my data it appeared that the busiest times of the day for riding were in the early morning and evening. The chart below illustrates this point quite clearly.

### Demographic Breakdown
The following charts show the break down of trips by Gender, time of day, and day of week.  It seems that Female ridership is more concentrated on the weekends, and the Male and Uknown seem to have higher levels of riding Monday through Friday.

Digging into this a little more the chart below shows the geographic starting point of the rides for August.  It appears that the majority of the rides start south of Central Park.

The next chart show the breakdown for Walk up Customers and Subscribers by day and Gender.  It appears that the majority of the ridership participation is among Male substribers on any give day of the week.

Doing the visualization definitely helped get an idea of how the bike sharing program is working in New York.
- It would be ipmortant to determine if trip distance was a big driver for usage given the differences in Des Moine and New York.
- It would also be important to determine if economic and structural differences (income, commute distance, and public transit options) in the two cities would increase or decrease ridership.
