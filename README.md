# Overview
## Bike Sharing Analysis In Tableau
In this analysis I am exploring data visualizations centered around Citibike which is a bike sharing business in New York City. My end goal is to construct a presentation deck in Tableau that I can use to see if a similar company would be successful in Des MOines, Iowa.

## Results
For my research I used data from the month of August 2019.  I picked August because the weather in August is more condusive to travel via bike given the milder weather then other months of the year where it might be more comfortable to travel by car. The sample I was using had 2,344,224 recorded rides in August, of these 81% were rides that would catagorized as "Subscription Based".

From my data it appeared that the busiest times of the day for riding were in the early morning and evening. The chart below illustrates this point quite clearly.
